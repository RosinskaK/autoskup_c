Commercial project for a trading company. 

If you want to know more about this project contact me directly on github or via <a href="rosinska.eu@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener"> mail </a>.

I independently designed and implemented this website for a motor industry trading company. I managed the complete development cycle, starting from requirements analysis to UI design and its execution.

## About the Project

Auto Skup is a commercial project, a two-page website, consisting of Home and Contact pages. To build it, I used React, Vite, MUI - responsive NavBar, and SCSS. Thanks to the applied Flexbox and responsive web design (RWD) the website is highly responsive and looks good on every device.

📱This website is also accessible in a mobile version.
