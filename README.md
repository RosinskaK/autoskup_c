## About the Project

Auto Skup is a commercial project, comprising a two-page website with Home and Contact pages. It was built using React, Vite, and MUI for a responsive NavBar, and styled with Sass. The application of Flexbox and responsive web design (RWD) ensures the website is highly responsive, appearing well on all devices.

üì±This website is also accessible in a mobile version.


## Usage

Auto Skup is a simple website that functions like a landing page, advertising the services of its owner. It provides information about possible forms of contact with the seller, details about the company, and highlights the benefits associated with its services for the visitors.
